1. Filter even numbers and double their values:

From the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], filter the even numbers and double their values.


2. Calculate the sum of an array:

Use reduce to calculate the sum of the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].


3. Find the first element greater than 10:

Use find to locate the first number greater than 10 in [2, 5, 8, 12, 15].


4. Sort an array in descending order:

Sort the array [3, 1, 4, 2, 5] in descending order.


5. Check if all elements are odd:

Use every to check if all elements in [1, 3, 5, 7] are odd.


6. Check if any number is divisible by 3:

Use some to see if any number in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] is divisible by 3.


7. Count the occurrences of each element:

From the array ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a'], count the occurrences of each element.


8. Create a new array of squared values:

Use map on [1, 2, 3, 4] to create [1, 4, 9, 16].


9. Remove duplicate elements:

From the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5], create a new array with unique values.


10. Merge two arrays:

Use concat to merge [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] into one array.


11. Extract elements greater than 5:

Filter the array [2, 7, 4, 8, 5] to only include numbers greater than 5.


12. Calculate the product of all numbers:

Use reduce to find the product of the numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4].


13. Remove the middle element from an array:

Use splice to remove the middle element of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].


14. Insert an element at a specific position:

Add 10 at the second position of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] using splice.


15. Create a string from an array:

Use join to convert ['Hello', 'world'] into "Hello world".


16. Split a string into an array:

Use split to transform the string "a,b,c" into ['a', 'b', 'c'].


17. Sort an array of strings alphabetically:

Sort the array ['banana', 'apple', 'cherry'].


18. Find the position of an element:

Use indexOf to find the index of 3 in [1, 2, 3, 4].


19. Reverse an array:

Use reverse to reverse the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].


20. Perform an action on each element:

Use forEach to log each element in [10, 20, 30].
